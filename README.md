# What is project for

Many accounting and financial software lack robust data analysis capabilities, requiring companies to invest in additional subscriptions for such functionalities. Drawing from my experience as an accountant, I've transformed this challenge into an opportunity by developing a user-friendly and efficient solution tailored to enhance decision-making processes within companies.

# Notice

The P&L Report Dataframe is customized for each company, with the 'DEMO' serving as the primary dataset for this project. By seamlessly converting your data into our tailored dataframe, you can effortlessly explore and engage with our workflow.
